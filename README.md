**Abstract**
The premise of our idea, was to create an accessible website, that gives information about MVSR. We used HTML and CSS to create this. Our website provides for the meticulous details that are not known to most students in our college. It also annihilates any vague links that may lead to confusion or frustration. It consists of a homepage and various other HTML pages that contain the contents related to the information regarding this particular institution. The style and structure of the website was done in way to optimize accessibility and mobility. Our best intentions were placed to maximize the satisfaction of the userâ€™s experience.
