<li><h3>Enrich the undergraduate experience through experimental learning, and fostering a personalized and supportive environment that makes learning joyful and stimulating</h3></li>
<li>
<h3>Provide opportunities to design mechanical engineering components and systems to meet specific needs through select courses</h3></li>
<li><h3>Provide opportunities to develop good communication skills, and to encourage creativity and entrepreneurial</h3></li>
<li><h3>Create awareness in professional responsibility, ethics, global impact of engineering solutions, and of the need for life-long learning.</h3></li>
<li><h3>Providing opportunities for training in the latest automotive technologies and encourage product development.</h3></li>
<li><h3>Providing research and intellectual resources to address contemporary and complex problems of industry and to advance research and applications.</h3></li>
</ul>
</br>
 

<h2>Program Educational Objectives</h2></br>

<h3>Automobile Engineering discipline has curriculum much in common with Mechanical Engineering and incorporates skills and expertise in the areas which are essential to most sectors of industry, and has specific orientation to the automobile industry.</h3></br>

<h3>Bachelors programme in Automobile Engineering in the college is aimed at preparing graduates who will</h3></br>
<ol>
<li>
<h3>Establish themselves as successful professionals while working independently or in multidisciplinary teams demonstrating professional, ethical and societal responsibilities.</h3></li>
<li><h3>Have high levels of technical competency and problem solving skills to generate innovative solutions to engineering problems including in areas specific to automobiles.</h3></li>
<li><h3>Continuously enhance their skills through training, independent inquiry, professional practices and / or pursuit of higher education or research.</h3></li>
<li><h3>Advance in their professional careers including increased technical and managerial responsibility as well as attainment of leadership</h3></li>
</ol>
