<h3><p>With its first batch graduating in 2001, Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering M V S R Engineering College has evolved with time and offers Under Graduate course B.E (EEE). Established in 1997, many bright students in the field over the last two decades received their training in the department. The UG curriculum provides strong base to the students in Electrical and Electronics Engineering and provides exposure to the latest technologies. It emphasizes both the fundamentals of Physics (devices) and Mathematical (systems) sides of Electrical and Electronics Engineering as well as multi disciplinary nature of the field. There are 10 well equipped laboratories and facilities which are being used for training of undergraduate students. Department offers the opportunity for both theoretical and experimental study and research in a wide range of subjects by fulfilling the University standards and Industry Technical needs.</h3></br>

<h3>The Department has started various student professional societies like IE, ISTE ,IEEE- PES Student chapters to enhance and extend their knowledge & make themselves in par with present developing world. The placement record of the Department has always been impressive.</h3></br>
