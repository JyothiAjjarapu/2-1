<h3>The department has well qualified, experienced and committed faculty for teaching, research and consultancy works. Six (6) faculty members are with PhD in their fields of specialization from prestigious Institutions and 11 faculty members are pursuing PhD program in their own area of specialization. All other faculty members are post graduates in engineering or technology from reputed institutions and University Colleges.</h3></br>

<h3>The department has an ambience of high discipline with commitment, conducive for high academic learning and training.  It is due to the very good academic environment and the excellent efforts of faculty and supporting staff that the students have brought laurels to the Department and Institute by securing the meritorious ranks in the university.</h3></br>

<h3>During the A.Y. 1994 – 95, 1995-96 First ranks among all the affiliated colleges of Osmania University were bagged by the students of MVSR Engineering College. Our students were securing top ranks (with in 10) every year. The department has also been able to achieve a high pass percentage of passes with distinction and first class in the university examinations.</h3></br>

<h3>On the Placements front too, the number of students of the Civil Engineering department, who got placed, has surpassed that from several other institutes.</h3></br>

<h3>The department is actively involved in research and consultancy. The main areas of research include Structural Engineering. The Department regularly receives consultancy projects from GHMC and other private organizations.</h3></br>

<h3>The Department is accorded recognition as 3rd party quality control check by Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) for testing, verifying, approving designs and certification.</h3></br>

<h3>For promoting academic atmosphere the department is actively involved in organizing regularly Seminars/Symposia/Workshops for the professional development of faculty, staff and students.</h3></br>

<h3>B.E Civil engineering programme has been accredited by NBA (National Board of Accreditation) of AICTE during 2002, 2007 & 2013.</h3></br>
